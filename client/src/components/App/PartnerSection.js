        Help increase access to COVID-19 testing and treatment
        <br />
        <br />
        Greetings,
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm Kathryn Strickland, Owner/Partner - Nurse Practitioner of a new
        mobile health service that is dedicated to increasing access to COVID-19
        testing and treatment in our community. I'm sure you are aware local
        need for COVID-19 testing and timely treatment far exceeds what our
        healthcare system can provide at this time. We are here to help, but we
        can't do it alone.
        <br />
        <br />
        Friendly Neighborhood NP is currently seeking community partners to host
        our mobile team on-site for COVID-19 testing events.
        <br />
        <br />
        At your testing event, each patient may choose from Rapid and/or PCR
        testing. Additionally, patients with COVID-like will have the
        opportunity to schedule an in-home visit for evaluation and treatment.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are reaching out to community minded organizations like yours in
        Richmond Hill, South Bryan County, and Savannah. Why here? Kate was
        raised in Savannah, and has lived in Richmond Hill with her family for
        five years. Amber was brought to Savannah when her husband received
        orders from his Coast Guard command. This is our home. COVID-19 has has
        torn through our community, infecting our families and friends, and
        disrupting our lives. We want to do our part in helping us heal, so we
        teamed up to bring our vision to life.
        <br />
        <br />
        What does hosting a COVID-19 testing event entail? If you avail your
        space, the Friendly Neighborhood NP team will do all the work, and
